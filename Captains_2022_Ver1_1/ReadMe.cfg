This is very outdated, and while most things here are still true, there's many, many more changes that arent listed here. For current change list, join Butter or Captains discord, there it should be ~95% accurate

Captains is a CTF mod that includes various balance and QOL changes. Im putting it up here so there's a detailed list of changes and the mod itself is easier to access.

List of changes:

New admin commands:

	!red playername - switches a player to red team
	!blue playername - switches a player to blue team
	!spec playername - switches a player to spectator team
	!allspec - switches all players to spectator team
	!players playername1 playername2 playername3 playernameX - works with any amount of players, switches first half of players to blue team, second half to red team
	!shuffleall - randomly switches every player team to either blue or red
	!shuffleallbut playername1 playernameX - like !shuffleall, but ignores players mentioned in the command
	!lockteams - prevents players from switching teams, use again to unlock team swapping
	!captains playername1 playername2 - locks teams, switches first player to blue and second player to red and makes them captains of their teams
	!pick playername - swaps a player from spectator team to your team, can be used by admins or team captains
	!randomcaptains - randomly chooses 2 players as captains
	!onerandomcaptain playername - sets playername as captain of one team and randomly chooses captain of the other team
	*playername doesnt have to be a player's full name, it can be first few letters of their nickname or username

New non-admin commands:

	!nospam X - hides same messages that were sent less than X ticks apart, by default its set to 30 ticks, or 1 second
	!spam - stops hiding chat spam
	!blob teamnum - same as vanilla !blob, but lets you set spawned blob's team to one that isn't your own
	Sound commands: not functional commands, they just play a sound when you say certain things, like "tuturu" or "conniptions"

Minimap:

	Now fully colored, shows all tiles
	Now has icons for trees

Indicators:

	Press mark player button (R by default, can be rebinded in settings) + 1-9 to put down an indicator at the position of your cursor
	Shows different indicators if you use numpad keys and if you hold down shift instead of mark player
	Every indicator has a different text/color and plays a different sound
	
Balance changes:

Siege:
	removed
Quarries:
	Don't require wood to run
	Give 100 wood and 30 stone every 40 seconds
Economy:
	Coin gain for dealing damage to enemies greatly increased
	Coin gain for placing stone blocks reduced from 4 to 3
	Coin loss on death reduced from 20% to 10%
	Coin loss on teamkill removed
	Added coin gain for assists
Resupplies:
	Amount of mats per builder resupply reverse scales with the amount of players in a team:
	4- players: 300 100; 120 30;
	5 players: 300 100; 100 25;
	6 players: 280 85; 90 21;
	7 players: 260 70; 80 18;
	8+ players: 240 55; 80 18;
	(first pair of numbers is amount of wood/stone during build time, second pair is amount of wood/stone during game time)
Green zones:
	There are 2 green zones, one for each team
	Building anything in your team's green zone takes a different amount of mats
	Location of green zones is set in map .png, similar to red zone
	Green zone only apprears if an admin uses !zone X Y, where X is percentage modifier of build prices and Y is time after which green zones activate (so !zone 150 600 would make it so building in green zone is 1.5 times more expensive, and make green zone appear 600 seconds after match started)
Doors:
	Damage taken from slashes increased
	Damage taken from bombs increased
Trampolines:
	Rotation unlocked, allowing you to aim it at any angle
	While holding LCtrl, trampoline will use vanilla angle-locked rotation
	Health increased
	Every time a player, a keg or a mine bounces off a trampoline, it takes damage, breaking after 7 bounces
	Cost increased from 150 to 200 wood
Drills:
	Max heat increased from 120 to 140
	Half damage to shields removed
	Heat rate against natural blocks (dirt, stone) increased from 4 to 6
	Delay between hits increased from 8 to 10 ticks when hitting natural tiles, except gold
	heat_cooldown_time increased from 5 to 6, making cooldown speed slower
	Water splashes cool the drill down by 50% of max heat (100% in vanilla)
Water arrows:
	Stack limit decreased to 1 per inventory slot
Sponges:
	Now block 3 water splashes instead of 2
Water buckets:
